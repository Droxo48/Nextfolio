        This space isn’t perfect, polished, or full of expert advice.

      <p className="mb-4">
        It’s just me—writing to find clarity, to understand myself better, and
        to slowly make peace with things I used to run from: anxiety, fear,
        self-doubt, and the weight of staying quiet for too long.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Here, I write about what I’m learning as I heal. Not as someone who has
        it all figured out, but as someone finally learning to open up, to
        speak, and to feel without shame.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Some days I write to make sense of my past. Other days I write because
        it’s the only way I know how to move forward.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If any of this resonates with you, I’m glad you’re here.
